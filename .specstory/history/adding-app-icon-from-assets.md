I'll help you add the app icon from the assets/images directory. First, let's check if the file exists and then add it to your application.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_

Great! I found the app logo file at `/Users/sudip/Projects/wealthwhiz/assets/images/ww-app-logo.jpg`. Now, I need to understand what type of application you have to properly add the icon. Let me check the project structure to determine the framework you're using.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_

I can see this is a Flutter application based on the presence of files like `.flutter-plugins`, `pubspec.yaml`, and the typical Flutter project structure with `ios/`, `android/`, and `web/` directories.

To add an app icon to a Flutter application, we need to update the icon configurations for each platform. Let's start by checking the pubspec.yaml file to see if there's already a flutter_launcher_icons configuration:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_

I see that we need to make a few changes to add the app icon:

1. First, we need to add the `flutter_launcher_icons` package to the dev dependencies
2. Configure the app icon in the pubspec.yaml
3. Run the flutter_launcher_icons package to generate the icons for all platforms

Let's start by updating the pubspec.yaml file:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
// ... existing code ...
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lints: ^4.0.0
  flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.13.1

flutter_launcher_icons:
  android: "launcher_icon"
  ios: true
  image_path: "assets/images/ww-app-logo.jpg"
  min_sdk_android: 21 # android min sdk min:16, default 21
  web:
    generate: true
    image_path: "assets/images/ww-app-logo.jpg"
    background_color: "#ffffff"
    theme_color: "#ffffff"
  windows:
    generate: true
    image_path: "assets/images/ww-app-logo.jpg"
    icon_size: 48 # min:48, max:256, default: 48
  macos:
    generate: true
    image_path: "assets/images/ww-app-logo.jpg"

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
// ... existing code ...
```

---

_**Assistant**_

Now, let's also make sure the assets section in the pubspec.yaml includes the assets/images directory:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
// ... existing code ...
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
// ... existing code ...
```

---

_**Assistant**_

Now that we've updated the pubspec.yaml file with the flutter_launcher_icons configuration and added the assets directory, let's run the flutter_launcher_icons package to generate the app icons for all platforms:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
cd /Users/sudip/Projects/wealthwhiz && flutter pub get
```

---

_**Assistant**_

Now let's run the flutter_launcher_icons command to generate the app icons for all platforms:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```

---

_**Assistant**_

I notice that the icons were successfully generated for Android and iOS, but there were warnings for Windows and macOS because those platform directories don't exist in your project. This is normal if you haven't added those platforms to your Flutter project yet.

Let's check if the Android and iOS icons were properly updated:

---

_**Assistant**_

_**Assistant**_

Let's check one of the mipmap directories to confirm the icon was updated:

Now let's check the iOS icons:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_

Great! The app icon has been successfully added to your Flutter application. Here's a summary of what we did:

1. Added the `flutter_launcher_icons` package to your dev dependencies in pubspec.yaml
2. Configured the app icon settings in pubspec.yaml to use your `assets/images/ww-app-logo.jpg` file
3. Added the assets/images directory to the assets section in pubspec.yaml
4. Ran `flutter pub get` to install the flutter_launcher_icons package
5. Ran `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons` to generate the app icons for all platforms

The app icon has been successfully updated for:
- Android: New launcher_icon.png files have been generated in the mipmap directories
- iOS: New icon files have been generated in the AppIcon.appiconset directory

If you want to add the app icon for Windows and macOS platforms in the future, you'll need to add those platforms to your Flutter project first using:
- `flutter create --platforms=windows .` for Windows
- `flutter create --platforms=macos .` for macOS

Then you can run the flutter_launcher_icons command again to generate icons for those platforms.

Your app now has the custom icon from your assets/images/ww-app-logo.jpg file!

remove debug banner

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you remove the debug banner from your Flutter application. The debug banner is the "DEBUG" label that appears in the top-right corner of your app when running in debug mode.

To remove it, we need to modify your main application file. Let me first locate it:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_

Now let's look at the content of the main.dart file:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_

I see that the main.dart file contains a `MyApp` class, but it's actually running a `WealthWhizApp` class. Let's check the app.dart file to find the main application widget:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_

Now I can see the main application widget in the app.dart file. To remove the debug banner, we need to add `debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false` to the MaterialApp widget. Let's make this change:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
// ... existing code ...
          return MaterialApp(
            title: 'WealthWhiz',
            debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
            theme: AppTheme.lightTheme,
            darkTheme: AppTheme.darkTheme,
            themeMode: themeProvider.themeMode,
            home: const SplashScreen(),
// ... existing code ...
```

---

_**Assistant**_

I also noticed there's a `MyApp` class in the main.dart file that isn't being used (since the app is using `WealthWhizApp` instead). For completeness, let's
