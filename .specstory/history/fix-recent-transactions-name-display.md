in dashboard screen -> recent transcation not showing name please fix it without changing any UI

I'll help you fix the issue with recent transactions not showing names in the dashboard screen. Let me first explore the relevant files to understand the problem.

Let me examine the dashboard screen file to understand how recent transactions are displayed:

Now, let me check the Transaction model to understand how the transaction data is structured:

Let's examine the Transaction model:

Now I understand the issue. In the dashboard screen, when displaying recent transactions, the code is using the transaction's description instead of a name property. Let's check how transactions are displayed in other screens to ensure consistency:

Let me continue reading the AllTransactionsScreen to see how transactions are displayed:

Let me check the transaction list item in the AllTransactionsScreen:

_**Assistant**_

Now I have a good understanding of the issue. In the dashboard screen, the transaction item is displaying the transaction's description as the title, but in the AllTransactionsScreen, it's displaying the category name as the title. 

Based on the Transaction model, I can see that each transaction has a description field which should be used for the name/title of the transaction. Let's fix the dashboard screen to show the transaction name correctly:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
// ... existing code ...
  Widget _buildTransactionItem(
    BuildContext context,
    String title,
    String amount,
    String date,
    IconData icon,
    Color color,
  ) {
    return ListTile(
      leading: CircleAvatar(
        backgroundColor: color.withOpacity(0.1),
        child: Icon(icon, color: color, size: 20),
      ),
      title: Text(_formatCategoryName(title)),
      subtitle: Text(date),
      trailing: Text(
        amount,
        style: AppConstants.titleMedium.copyWith(
          color: amount.startsWith('+') ? Colors.green : Colors.red,
          fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  String _formatCategoryName(String category) {
    // Split by dots and take the last part (in case of enum values)
    final name = category.toString().split('.').last;
    // Capitalize first letter and keep rest lowercase
    return name[0].toUpperCase() + name.substring(1).toLowerCase();
  }
// ... existing code ...
```

---

_**Assistant**_

Now I need to update the part where the transaction items are created to pass the category instead of the description:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
// ... existing code ...
                  else
                    Column(
                      children: _transactions
                          .take(3) // Show only the 3 most recent transactions
                          .map((transaction) => _buildTransactionItem(
                                context,
                                transaction.category.toString(),
                                transaction.type == TransactionType.income
                                    ? '+\$${transaction.amount.toStringAsFixed(2)}'
                                    : '\$${transaction.amount.toStringAsFixed(2)}',
                                _getRelativeDate(transaction.date),
                                _getCategoryIcon(transaction.category),
                                transaction.type == TransactionType.income
                                    ? Colors.green
                                    : Colors.red,
                              ))
                          .toList(),
                    ),
// ... existing code ...
```

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! I've fixed the issue with the recent transactions not showing the name in the dashboard screen. Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. I identified that the dashboard screen was using the transaction's description as the title, while the AllTransactionsScreen was using the category name.

2. I updated the dashboard screen to:
   - Pass the transaction category instead of the description to the _buildTransactionItem method
   - Added a _formatCategoryName method to properly format the category name (capitalize first letter)
   - Modified the _buildTransactionItem method to use the formatted category name

These changes ensure that the recent transactions in the dashboard screen now display the transaction category name (e.g., "Food", "Shopping", etc.) instead of the description, which is consistent with how transactions are displayed in the AllTransactionsScreen.

The UI remains unchanged as requested - we're still showing the same transaction items with the same layout, just with the correct data displayed.

in transaction screen the add floating button not doing any thing it should navigate to add transaction form screen

I'll help you fix the floating action button in the transaction screen to navigate to the add transaction form screen. Let me first check the transaction screen file to understand its structure.

_**Assistant**_

Now let me check if there's a transaction form screen in the project:

---

_**Assistant**_

_**Assistant**_

Great! I found the transaction form screen. Let me check its structure to understand how to navigate to it:

---

_**Assistant**_

_**Assistant**_

Now I have all the information I need to fix the floating action button in the AllTransactionsScreen. I'll update it to navigate to the TransactionFormScreen when pressed:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
// ... existing code ...
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          Navigator.push(
            context,
            MaterialPageRoute(
              builder: (context) => TransactionFormScreen(),
            ),
          ).then((_) => _loadTransactions());
        },
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
// ... existing code ...
```

---

_**Assistant**_

I need to add the import for the TransactionFormScreen:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import '../models/models.dart';
import '../services/database_service.dart';
import '../services/firebase_service.dart';
import 'dart:io';
import 'transaction_form_screen.dart';

class AllTransactionsScreen extends StatefulWidget {
// ... existing code ...
```

---

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! I've successfully fixed the floating action button in the AllTransactionsScreen. Here's what I did:

1. I updated the `onPressed` method of the FloatingActionButton to navigate to the TransactionFormScreen when pressed.
2. I added a `.then((_) => _loadTransactions())` callback to refresh the transactions list after returning from the form screen,
